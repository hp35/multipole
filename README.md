# Derivation of the expressions for optically active polarization densities, from the very basics of the multipole expansion

In this analysis, the path from the classical multipole expansion of the
potentials over to the polarizability of the medium is outlined, and
interpreted in terms of the contribution of the individual multipole moments.
